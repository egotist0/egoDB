egoDB is a fast k/v database compatible with LSM tree and B+ tree.

Key features:

* **Combine the advantages of LSM and B+ tree**
* **Get rid of the redundancy of SSTable**
* **Fast read/write performance**
* **Much lower read and space amplification than typical LSM**

## Design Overview
egoDB is inspired by a paper named [SLM-DB](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast19/presentation/kaiyrakhmet) in USENIX FAST â€™19, and the [Wisckey](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast16/fast16-papers-lu.pdf) paper also helps a lot.
